1_A_Normal_Command
 Shows a normal command pattern with a command interface and two derived commands

2_A_Delegate_Command
 Shows how a delegates encapsulates/abstracts a methods interface so that the called method can be changed

3_A_Composite_Command
 Shows how the first example can be extended with a compositve, to allow calling a hierachy of commands in one call.

4_CompositeCommand_Is_An_Event
 Shows how C# contains an implementation of the 3rd example by using events
